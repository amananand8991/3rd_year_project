# Keldysh field theory
My aim was to study the Keldysh field theory(a non-equilibirium Quantum Statistical Mechanics). Along the way of understanding that, i came across these topics:

* Second quantisation
* Path integrals
* Functional field integrals
* Perturbation theory
* Non-equilibirium Classical Statistical Mechanics
* Non-equilibirium Quantum Statistical Mechanics
* Solitons & Instantons
* Topology
