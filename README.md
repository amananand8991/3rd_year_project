# Keldysh field theory
My aim was to study the Keldysh field theory(a non-equilibrium Quantum Statistical Mechanics). I read 3chapters(Introduction, bosons and fermions) from Alex kamanev's book on field theory of non-equilibrium systems. Along the way of understanding that, I came across these topics:

* Second quantization
* Path integrals
* Functional field integrals
* Perturbation theory
* Non-equilibrium Classical Statistical Mechanics
* Non-equilibrium Quantum Statistical Mechanics
* Solitons & Instantons
* Topology
